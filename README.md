# Exposing-Undercounts-in-the-Census-through-Regression-Modeling

This repository contains my paper 'Exposing Undercounts in the Census through Regression Modeling' and the Python notebook with all of my programming. The paper was published in the Journal of Student Research, high school edition. I am currently working on making the notebook cleaner and more intuitive to guide through, so although the code works, it may be confusing in its current state. Feel free to message me if you have any questions!
